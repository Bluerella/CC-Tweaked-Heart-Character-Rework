New features in CC: Tweaked 1.109.7

* Improve performance of removing and unloading wired cables/modems.

Several bug fixes:
* Fix monitors sometimes not updating on the client when chunks are unloaded and reloaded.
* `colour.toBlit` correctly errors on out-of-bounds values.
* Round non-standard colours in `window`, like `term.native()` does.
* Fix the client monitor rendering both the current and outdated contents.
